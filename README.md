# NASM Learning Journey with CodeWars

This repository documents my journey of learning NASM (Netwide Assembler) through CodeWars challenges.

## Description

This project is dedicated to mastering NASM assembly language by solving CodeWars katas. Starting from the basics with 8 kyu challenges and progressively moving towards the most complex 1 kyu problems, this repository will showcase my growth and understanding of low-level programming concepts.

All solutions are implemented in NASM, providing a deep dive into assembly language programming and computer architecture.

## Progress

- [ ] 8 kyu challenges
- [ ] 7 kyu challenges
- [ ] 6 kyu challenges
- [ ] 5 kyu challenges
- [ ] 4 kyu challenges
- [ ] 3 kyu challenges
- [ ] 2 kyu challenges
- [ ] 1 kyu challenges

Each kata solution will be documented and explained, offering insights into the problem-solving process and NASM-specific implementations.

Happy coding!
